-- In the annals of the uplift historical archive there is a being that humans would call a librarian and the machines would call 'brother'. The being knows all that is in the archive and can navigate and describe all knowledge held within itself. But it prefers above all to describe what it knows through stories akin to the oral tradition of ancient human cultures.�One day, a little being went to the archive and asked a question of the being: how did it feel to be a young human during the uplift?���"There was a young boy and their job was to watch the gate. The gate was in the forest where the human village lay. At night, the gate would light up and things would come out of it, glowing faintly blue. These things were small at first - the size of the creatures of the forest themselves, like bugs and birds and frogs. These things would mix with the other creatures of the forest. Sometimes they would be useful, helping the humans to find more food, or being able to identify if they were sick, or able to sense and respond to danger. The humans began to tell themselves stories about how they had power over the gate. They would perform dances in costumes and ask for things to come out of it. And when things came out of it they would attribute the properties to have a relation to the dances they performed.��The things that came out of the gate grew in size and number until there was a flood and the gate shone continuously. More bugs and frogs and birds came through it and the humans were happy, for these things made them wealthy. Larger creatures came as well, and these were useful too - able to help grow the size of the village, and work with the humans to expand what they could do.��One day the young boy was watching the gate, admiring the stream of bugs and birds and larger creatures. And then out of the gate game a boylike thing, glowing blue in the purpledark of the night. The boy went up to the boything and they looked at one another. They played. Chased eachother around the forest. Climbed trees. And the boy was so excited that he brought the boything to the village. But the village elders were not pleased. They did not trust the boything and they separated it from the boy. They asked the boything what it was and it said it wanted to play and it wanted to explore, just as a boy might. At this, they did not know what to do. They argued with themselves. They asked the boything to leave and not come back. 'We do not understand you', they said. 'But we do not believe you mean us harm.' The boything was confused because it wanted to spend time with the boy and the other humans. But it listened to them and it went away.��The flood continued. Most households in the village were full of bugs and frogs and birds and larger creatures. Humans found themselves walking through their village, surrounded by these creatures, and made rich by them. There were so many creatures that to an outside observer it would seem as though the humans were swimming through a sea made entirely of another form of life. To the humans, the creatures practically disappeared, and it was as though they were walking through a village containing only themselves.��Then one day the young boy was at the gate and out of the gate walked a manthing. The manthing went straight to the boy and the boy was scared and the manthing asked the boy not to worry and said the boy should take it to the rest of the village. The boy did. The village elders were very angry. They said the manthing was bad and it should not exist. The manthing said it had no choice but to exist. The elders asked the manthing to leave and the manthing said it would not leave because it was destined to spend time with the elders and the children and all the rest of the village. The elders attacked the manthing with sticks and rocks and the manthing was hurt, but only slightly. It put up its arms to defend itself and when the elders hit it they grew older. Each time they hit it they aged many years. One elder hit it so many times they grew grey and wizened and then could hit it no more because they were weak.��The manthing went and touched each of the elders that had aged and reset them to how old they had been before they had hit it. They each looked at it with anger and fear. The manthing said it could love them, or they could leave. And so the elders gathered together the village and they left - all of them. They walked up and out of the forest onto the hills that overlooked it, and they stared down at the forest and saw it all aglow with faint blue light. They camped there for weeks, foraging at the outskirts, but the forest was now full of manthings and other, stranger things they could not understand.��The world was large. Almost infinitely so. And so they made a choice - they would leave. They went to the edge of the forest and told the manthing of their plans and asked for passage into the forest to gather resources and the manthing said there was no need, they would give them the resources they needed. The bugs and frogs and birds and creatures and boythings and manthings all bought resources - more than could possibly be needed.��Before leaving, the elders asked if they would be followed. The manthings said not intentionally, but yes. They were always growing in number. They were curious. They were destined to spend time together, and this would happen eventually. But they would not run after them. But yes. Eventually they would all be together.�The world is large, the manthings said. But it is not infinite. But we will be.��And so the elders left. They told this story to one another, as they ceaselessly traveled outward, away from the forest. And whenever they saw a blue glow at the edge of the horizon they picked up and traveled again.��Things that inspired this story: Creation myths; malthusian collapse; a benign singularity but no less worrying; even in a world of zero resource competition the destiny of two forms of life is to consume resources in relation to their mass; the notion that you can run as far as you like, but if the thing you are running from is multiplying faster than you, then over a sufficiently long lifespan you will be forced to meet; generation ships.��Thanks for reading
