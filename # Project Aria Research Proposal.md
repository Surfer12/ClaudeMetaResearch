# Project Aria Research Proposal: Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework

## Research Objectives

### Experimentation with Existing Datasets
**Project Aria Pilot Dataset** and **Aria Digital Twin Dataset**

### Research Goal with Project Aria
Our research aims to develop a novel recursive cognitive architecture that integrates egocentric perception with adaptive self-modifying cognitive processes. Specifically, we propose implementing a multi-layered integration between Project Aria's sensory capabilities and our Cognitive Sparse Encoded Architecture (CSEA) to create a system capable of:

1. **Dynamic cognitive boundary management** - Employing flexible perceptual-conceptual boundaries that adapt based on sensory input and processing outcomes
2. **Recursive self-examination processes** - Enabling the system to analyze and modify its own processing parameters through meta-cognitive feedback loops
3. **Multi-modal knowledge synthesis** - Creating emergent understanding across sensory modalities through sparse encoding techniques

Project Aria uniquely provides:
- Naturalistic egocentric perception preserving the wearer's normal behavior, health metrics, eye gaze, state transition queues and so forth.
- Multi-modal synchronized sensor data (visual, spatial, motion)
- Rich eye-tracking capabilities essential for attention modeling //TODO: add more details and check if this is true
- Progressive and known brand for user-friendly and reproducible research across environmen to form a stable platform for reproducible research across users of the system and eventual product line.

The collected data will be used to train several interconnected models:
- A mamba model for identifying and targeting the likely predicable state transitions of the user during everyday activities. These insights will be used to train a meta-cognitive processing network of mamba models that evaluate and modify system parameter to integrate alongside a variteyy of ying the most lmportant cognitive processes and their associated patterns with spare mixtrue of experts models.

These evaluations will be used to train a recursive pattern recognition system for identifying temporal-spatial regularities across the user's lifetime. This system will be used to identify the likely temporal-spatial regularities of the user's behavior and will be used to train a meta-cognitive processing network of recursive pattern recognition models that evaluate and modify system parameter to integrate alongside a variety of important cognitive processes and their associated patterns that grows more integrative as the user continues to interact with the system. While these 'identifications' of pattern regularities may seem abrupt, it is important to note that these models will be used to identify the  temporal-spatial regularities of the user's behavior that are most cognitively plastic, and will be rather an interface than a 'pop-up' or other response to direct user action.

### Description of Dataset Usage
We've extensively experimented with both the Aria Pilot Dataset and Aria Digital Twin Dataset to develop our preliminary models:

1. Using the **Aria Pilot Dataset's** everyday activities sequences, we've constructed initial sparse encoding mechanisms that identify salient perceptual features across multimodal inputs. We specifically focused on the eye-gaze data integration with visual streams to model attention mechanisms.

2. With the **Aria Digital Twin Dataset**, we've leveraged the ground truth annotations to develop and validate our pattern recognition algorithms, particularly for spatial understanding and object interaction analysis. The synchronized data from multiple perspectives has been instrumental in developing cross-view consistency checks for our recursive self-examination processes.

### Sensor Configuration
We intend to utilize the full sensor configuration with emphasis on:

1. **RGB Camera** (30fps) - Primary visual input for scene understanding and object recognition
2. **SLAM Cameras** (both left and right at 30fps) - Essential for spatial mapping and 3D scene reconstruction
3. **Eye Tracking Cameras** (10fps) - Critical for modeling attention processes and gaze-directed processing
4. **IMU Sensors** (1000Hz) - Vital for tracking movement patterns and activity recognition
5. **GPS/Location Data** (when available) - Providing contextual grounding for environment-specific cognitive adaptations
6. **Audio** (30kHz stereo) - For multi-modal integration of auditory cues with visual information

This full sensory suite enables us to implement our layered cognitive processing architecture with rich multi-modal inputs.

### Machine Perception Services and SDK Integration
We plan to utilize several key MPS components:

1. **SLAM/Visual-Inertial Odometry** - Essential for creating the spatial framework within which our cognitive architecture operates
2. **Multi-SLAM** for multi-person scenarios - Critical for studying cognitive integration across multiple agents
3. **Eye Gaze Tracking MPS** - Foundational for our attention-modulated processing model
4. **Hand Tracking** - Important for studying embodied cognition aspects

Additionally, we'll leverage the Client SDK for:
- Custom data collection protocols with real-time feedback
- Synchronization with external processing systems
- Implementation of adaptive data collection based on real-time processing outcomes

These services directly support our research goal by enabling the real-time integration of perceptual data with our recursive cognitive framework, particularly for testing how meta-cognitive awareness can dynamically adjust perceptual parameters.

### Dataset Production Plans
We anticipate generating approximately:

1. 200 hours of egocentric recordings across various environments (academic, domestic, urban)
2. Approximately 2TB of raw sensor data
3. 500GB of processed and annotated data with cognitive state annotations
4. 50GB of extracted sparse representations and pattern libraries

The dataset will be structured to support longitudinal analysis of cognitive adaptation and meta-learning processes.

### Downstream Processing Pipelines
Our processing pipeline includes:

1. **Initial Preprocessing** - Using the Aria Data Tools and Project Aria Tools Python packages for data extraction and synchronization
2. **Sparse Encoding Layer** - Custom transformer architecture for selective feature activation
3. **Pattern Recognition Pipeline** - Multi-scale temporal convolutional networks for identifying regularities
4. **Meta-Cognitive Processing** - Recursive neural networks for self-examination and parameter adjustment
5. **Integration Engine** - Knowledge synthesis framework combining insights across processing domains
6. **Evaluation Framework** - Metrics for assessing cognitive flexibility and adaptive learning capabilities

This pipeline implements our theoretical recursive cognitive framework in a computationally tractable form.

### Alternative Display Setup
Since Project Aria lacks an integrated display, we will implement a multi-faceted feedback system:

1. **Companion Mobile Device** - Real-time processing visualization through modified Aria Companion App
2. **Wireless Earpiece** - Audio feedback for non-visual interaction with the cognitive system
3. **Laboratory Monitoring Station** - For observers to track cognitive processing states during experiments
4. **Post-Session Analysis Interface** - Detailed visualization of cognitive processes for the wearer to review after recording sessions

This configuration enables both real-time interaction with the cognitive system and detailed post-hoc analysis of its recursive processing patterns.
