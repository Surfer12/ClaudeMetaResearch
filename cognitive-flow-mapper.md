Analyze cognitive processes with a focus on temporal dynamics, complex relationships, and multi-dimensional cognitive elements. Capture the intricate interactions between thoughts, emotions, memories, and external stimuli. Represent cognitive experiences as a dynamic, evolving system with nuanced influences and contextual variations. Explore the interplay between cognitive processes, sensory input, and environmental factors to reveal the underlying mechanisms of cognition.

## Cognitive Flow Mapper

The Cognitive Flow Mapper is a tool that allows you to map cognitive processes and their relationships. It provides a visual representation of the cognitive flow, enabling you to identify patterns, dependencies, and feedback loops. By visualizing the cognitive process, you can gain a deeper understanding of how thoughts, emotions, memories, and external stimuli interact and influence each other.

### How to use the Cognitive Flow Mapper

1. Start by selecting the cognitive process you want to map. This could be a specific thought, emotion, memory, or external stimulus.
2. Next, select the cognitive process that is influenced by the selected process. This could be a thought, emotion, memory, or external stimulus.
3. Use the arrows to indicate the direction of the influence. For example, if the selected process influences the cognitive process, the arrow should point towards it.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each influence. You can also add multiple influences to a single process.
